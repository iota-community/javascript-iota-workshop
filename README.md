# IOTA Workshop

Simple examples to help a developer work through interacting with the IOTA network. 

### Getting started

To start playing with these examples run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iota-community/iota-workshop.git
cd iota-workshop
npm i
node code/1-hello-world.js
```

You should receive a message including the statistics of an IOTA node. This means you can explore and run the other examples.

- 1-hello-world.js
