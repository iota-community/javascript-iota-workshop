# IOTA Workshop

Simple examples to help a developer work through interacting with the IOTA network and the [iota.js](https://github.com/iota/iota.js) library. 

⚠️ **Attention** ⚠️
The workshops currently uses the [iota.js](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.js/tree/chrysalis) library with the chrysalis branch. This is an experimental library for the testing phase.

You should use the higher level node bindings in the future. The higher level node bindings will be much more abstract and easier to work with.

### Getting started

To start playing with these examples run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iota-community/iota-workshop.git
cd iota-workshop
npm install # or yarn install
node code/1-hello-world.js
```

You should receive a message including the statistics of an IOTA node. This means you can explore and run the other examples.



### Examples included

Here are the examples included:

- 1-hello-world
- 2-send-hello
- 3-fetch-hello
- 4-create-address
- 5-check-balance
